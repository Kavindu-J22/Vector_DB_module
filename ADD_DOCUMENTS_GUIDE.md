    "content": """
    TechStart Inc. licensed cloud-based accounting software from CloudSoft under a 
    three-year Software as a Service (SaaS) agreement. The license included unlimited 
    users for $10,000 monthly with data storage up to 1TB. TechStart exceeded the 
    storage limit by 500GB for six months without upgrading their plan. CloudSoft 
    terminated the agreement and seeks damages for breach of contract terms. The case 
    involves interpretation of SaaS licensing terms, usage limitations, and remedies 
    for contract violations in cloud computing agreements.
    """,
    "doctrine": "contract_law",
    "court": "commercial_court",
    "year": 2023,
    "jurisdiction": "federal"
}
```

### **Tort Law Example:**
```python
{
    "id": "tort_new_001", 
    "title": "Autonomous Vehicle Accident - Product Liability",
    "content": """
    Plaintiff was injured when an autonomous vehicle manufactured by AutoTech Corp 
    failed to detect a pedestrian crossing and struck the plaintiff at a crosswalk. 
    The vehicle's AI system was operating in full autonomous mode when the accident 
    occurred. Investigation revealed that the vehicle's sensors were functioning 
    properly, but the AI decision-making algorithm failed to properly classify the 
    pedestrian as an obstacle requiring emergency braking. This case presents novel 
    questions about product liability for AI-powered systems and the standard of 
    care for autonomous vehicle manufacturers.
    """,
    "doctrine": "tort_law",

    Law enforcement obtained defendant's location data from his smartphone without 
    a warrant by requesting the information directly from the cellular service 
    provider. The data revealed defendant's movements over a 30-day period and was 
    used to establish his presence at multiple crime scenes. Defendant argues that 
    warrantless collection of digital location data violates his Fourth Amendment 
    rights and that the digital age requires enhanced privacy protections. The case 
    addresses the intersection of technology and constitutional privacy rights in 
    the digital era.

## üîß **How to Add Documents Programmatically**

### **Method 3: Create Your Own Document Loader**

```python
def add_custom_documents():
    """Add your custom legal documents."""
    
    # Initialize vector database
    vector_db = VectorDatabase()
    
    # Your custom documents
    custom_documents = [
        {
            "id": "custom_001",
            "title": "Your Case Title",
            "content": "Your legal document content...",
            "doctrine": "contract_law",
            "court": "district_court", 
            "year": 2023,
            "jurisdiction": "state"
        },
        # Add more documents here...
    ]
    
    # Add documents to database
    success = vector_db.add_documents(custom_documents)
    
    if success:
        print(f"‚úÖ Added {len(custom_documents)} custom documents")
        
        # Test search
        results = vector_db.search("your search query", top_k=5)
        for result in results:
            print(f"Found: {result['title']}")
    else:
        print("‚ùå Failed to add documents")

# Run your custom loader
add_custom_documents()
```

    # Process in batches of 50
    batch_size = 50
    for i in range(0, len(documents), batch_size):
        batch = documents[i:i + batch_size]
        success = vector_db.add_documents(batch)
        print(f"Processed batch {i//batch_size + 1}: {success}")
```

### **For 1000+ Documents:**
